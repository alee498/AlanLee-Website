        <p class="lead mb-4">
        I have worked in multiple companies doing multiple tasks ranging from making noodles to writing code for high profile companies as well as other organizations. I have ties with multiple organizations such as Amazon, Walmart, Whole Foods, among other high profile companies. Furthermore, I have started up my own business in the food industry as well as opening up programs for students of all ages to be able to gain any amount of work experience with no prior skills or experience. These centers and organizations can be found in locations across the globe. This has shown me to be globally recognized by world leaders, underground gangs, and the black market. I also have worked in game design, designing character models and skins for players across a plethora of video games. Not only working on game design for video games, I also have experience designing board games for players of all audiences, from children to retired couples. Besides this I have computer management skills as I frequently organize the computers and files of multiple computers on a daily basis. These skills are important as they show organizational skills on a daily basis. Even though it may not seem like much it goes to show how important organizational skills means to me. This will allow me to get my difficult and lengthy projects to be fully completed, professionally on time, as well as free up more time in my schedule to do other important tasks that I may not have the time to do so. Even though this seems like a lot of work, it really is not because I am using these tasks everyday and that they have been ingrained into my work on a day to day basis. The amount of organization for every task is different but I am able to use whatever few resources I have in order to make the best out of every situation. This allows me to plan all my difficult work and tasks and place them into order of highest importance and complete on time without having any additional worries. For example, when working with my peers in a group setting I instantly set out a calendar to schedule their free times so we can work the most effectively in a short period of time and finish the project as soon as possible. Though this may seem daunting at first, I have gradually come used to it as I am just looking out or the best of the team. In the end, this allows me to boost our efficiency and cut costs through any project or assignment that I am tasked to do with them. Even though some of my peers may not agree with my methodology, I believe it is the most efficient and effective way to complete any amount of tasks. If you have read this far already, buckle up because there are two more paragraphs to do about my biography and this is what has came across the factual parts of my life. <br><br>

        These next two paragraphs are going to contain less interesting information as I do not expect anyone else to make it through my first paragraph and I am trying to reach the recommended three five hundred word paragraphs that is required for this lab. I have been working in this field of work for the longest time, as far as back I can remember, cooking. I remember watching youtube videos since I was a little kid trying to learn how to make my favorite dishes, and to be able to share these delectable meals with my friends, family, and even strangers. However, as I grew older I realized that this was in no ways that simple. Experimenting recipes and formulas became the bane of my existence as I was unable to formulate anything original from my imagnations. My dreams were crushed as I tried to think of bizarre new dishes that I thought of in my imagination or were inspired by the media, such as blue milk from Star Wars. Hitting this brick wall made me review my choices thus far in my cooking career. I asked myself many questions. Was I really able to do this? Am I capable of making any good food? I canâ€™t even crack an egg properly, can I do anything right? These fears were unfounded as I realized that if I can not cook, I simply just need to hire somebody else to fulfill my dreams and career pursuits. With this newfound knowledge I decided to search for employees at the ripe age of ten. I first looked to my parents, and asked if they would want to work for me if I started up my own cooking place. Being my parents, they obviously said yes, and my confidence grew. Next I asked my classmates, offering to pay them for any leftovers they make that were left at the end of the night. As most of them wanted to play along, I had grown my employee base to a large amount. However, these dreams were cut short, as I tried to invite all my employees into my house for some test cooking. My parents realized that I was trying to be serious and attempted to use the stove, and shut down the dream completely. That eventually led to my current job as a plan consultant, as my experience of having my plans ruined allowed me to help view and create dreams for other people. With my experience of my dreams being ruined, I realized that I can create dreams for other people, which was my goal all along. By having my dream ruined, I realized that I did not want any other people to experience what I had. Now I help people plan their dreams and help make their dreams come true. Furthermore I have even opened opportunity centers where people can get anything they need, need it be experiences, or even clothes and food. This ends my second paragraph of my experience that totally happened.<br><br>

        If you got here, then I applaud you for being able to sit through two entire paragraphs of actual events that definitely actually happened. I hope I am not going to be marked down with these small snippets of unprofessionalism, but it must be done. So buckle up, the end is near, you will have reached the end of biography. Here I will talk about how I first learned about my career choice of being a management major when I first tasted the power of management and controlling others. Each time I was able to take a leadership position I thirsted for more and more power. Eventually I lunged for power every single time it was offered to me. Unfortunately, there were simply not enough opportunities for me to get the experience that I much desired. With my power grabs eventually coming up empty, I looked towards something else that could fill up the hole in my heart that was left with the lack of power. To this, I poured all my emotions into singing and editing music. All this raw emotion that was left in me when I no longer could control people was finally let loose into a healthy medium, that was, music. Even though I was not able to write my own music, I was able to sing other peopleâ€™s songs and pour my own emotions into it. Furthermore, by editing it, it made me seem like I was a professional singer despite without being able to sing in tune for the longest time. Despite that I never gave up and kept on editing until one day, I realized that time I spent editing had been constantly shortening, I thought my singing skills had improved. This was not the case, instead I had become so proficient in editing audio, that I was able to edit three songs in the time I used to edit one. This opened my eyes to my true passion, not singing, but editing. This allowed me to edit for major youtubers and streamers, putting my own twist on the editing scheme and video style of these celebrities. In this way my power complex came back. I was able to micromanage every little part of the video I wanted to edit, add, or even delete. These experiences that I built up in my past allowed me to be the amazing editor that I have now become. Not only did the past influence my job choices, it allowed me to grow professionally as a person and worker. Now I lead a team of editors, editing and screening through dozens of millions of videos across the web. This is now my only passion as I only work in editing videos as well as audio files for people across the world. Having reject many offers from other companies, I have become determined to run my own company, controlling the process down to the very smallest details. Now having hit my word count, I will end my biography here, but I assure you that there are many more paragraphs to go.
